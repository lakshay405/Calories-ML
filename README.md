# Calories-ML
Calorie Prediction Model using XGBoost
This project focuses on predicting calorie expenditure based on exercise and user demographics using machine learning techniques, specifically XGBoost regression. The goal is to build a predictive model that estimates the calories burned during physical activities given data on exercise type, user attributes (age, gender, height, weight), and other relevant features.

Dataset
The project utilizes two main datasets:

calories.csv: Contains calorie expenditure data.
exercise.csv: Includes details about exercise types performed.
Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing:

Load data from CSV files into Pandas DataFrames (calories_df and exercise_df).
Merge exercise data with calorie information (merged_data).
Handle missing values and encode categorical variables (e.g., 'Gender' encoded as numerical values).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize distributions of demographic features like age, height, weight, and gender using seaborn plots.
Calculate and plot correlation matrices to understand relationships between variables.
Model Training and Evaluation:

Prepare feature matrix (X) and target vector (Y) for regression.
Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Initialize an XGBoost regressor model and train it on the training data.
Predict calorie values for the test set and evaluate model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Results:

The trained XGBoost model provides accurate predictions of calorie expenditure based on input features.
Libraries Used
numpy for numerical operations.
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
sklearn for model selection and evaluation (train_test_split, metrics).
xgboost for building and training the XGBoost regression model.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict calorie expenditure based on user exercise habits and demographic information. The insights gained from this predictive model can potentially help individuals and fitness professionals better understand and manage calorie burn during physical activities.
